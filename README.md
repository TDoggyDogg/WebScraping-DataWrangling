# WebScraping-DataWrangling

This was the final Project I completed with two other students for our WebScraping-DataWrangling class.
We found data online about teachers salary, cost of living, and cost of getting a four year degree and used that to determin what
were the best and worst states to presure teaching as a career. We used a python notebook to generate our results.
